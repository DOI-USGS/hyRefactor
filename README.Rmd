The goal of `hydrofab` is to provide consistent hydrologic and hydraulic network manipulation tool chains to achieve model application ready datasets from a consistent reference fabric.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hydrofab like so:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mikejohnson51/hydrofab")
```

Soon to be ...

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("NOAA-OWP/hydrofab")
```

## Introduction 

This package is based around the same concepts as [nhdplusTools](https://usgs-r.github.io/nhdplusTools/) and uses its utilities extensively. It is the creation of merging the 
previous `hyRefactor` and `hyAggregate` packages in an attempt to provide a common software stack of fabricating hydrofabrics.

### Refactoring and Aggregating

The concept of refactoring as intended here includes:

1) **Splitting** large or long catchments to create a more uniform catchment size
distribution,  
2) **collapsing** catchment topology to eliminate small catchments


The concept of aggregating as intended here includes **aggregating** catchments into groups based on existing network topology and defined critiera. Two primary use cases are offered:

1. Aggregrgating to a set of defined outlet locations
2. Aggregating to a uniform catchment size with enforced minimun areas and lengths.


This type of functionality is especially relevant to modeling applications that
need specific modeling unit characteristics but wish to preserve the network as
much as possible for interoperability with other applications 


### Check notes:

In addition to typical R package, a Dockerfile is included in this repository. Once built, it can be run with the following command.

```
docker build -t hydrofab_test .

# Windows
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src hydrofab_test /bin/bash -c "cp -r /src/* /check/ && cp /src/.Rbuildignore /check/ && cd /check && Rscript -e 'devtools::build()' && R CMD check --as-cran ../hydrofab_*"

# Linux/Mac
docker run --rm -it -v %cd%:/src hydrofab_test /bin/bash -c "cp -r /src/* /check/ && cp /src/.Rbuildignore /check/ && cd /check && Rscript -e 'devtools::build()' && R CMD check --as-cran ../hydrofab_"
```
